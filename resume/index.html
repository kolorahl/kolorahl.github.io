    <h1>Resume</h1>
  </div>

  <p>
    Some people have tried to get into contact with me and want to know more
    about my skills and my background, so I've created this page. Check below
    for the different ways of viewing my professional resume.
  </p>

  <h3>Google Drive</h3>
  <p>
    You can check out my resume online
    via <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d-GVDt_8ukl6N3g7Q9mlNVqvcOZ3vOi_nsVlQ6woH-0/edit?usp=sharing">Google
    Drive</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>re.vu</h3>
  <p>
    There's a visual-pleasing site
    called <a href="http://re.vu/tyler.margison">re.vu</a> where I also try to
    keep my skills and work experience updated. It's like an interactive resume,
    kind of, but with more eye-candy than interaction.
  </p>

  <h3>Right Here</h3>
  <p>
    If you're not into Google Drive or re.vu, don't worry: I've got a version of
    my resume right on this page. Has all the stuff you need to know in an
    easy-to-consume format.

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
      I can program in any language. Seriously. Maybe not immediately, but give
      me a bit of time and I can be programming in whatever language I need
      to. I can also use any database. Or any other piece of technology for that
      matter. It's called learning, and I do it well.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I've worked for places and I get stuff done. End of question.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      I was given a test called the HSEE, or High School Exit Exam, after only
      one year of high school. The test was described as containing the minimum
      knowledge required to be considered for graduating high school. I aced
      it. I also did some other stuff after that, but it's not nearly as
      impressive.
    </p>

    <h2>Why You Should Hire Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm actually an extremely fair and awesome individual. If you have work
      you need done, or if you just want a consultation about what it is that
      needs to be done, I will always aim to deliver the best and second-best
      options. Why do I include second-best? Because I know time, money, and
      other factors sometimes prevent the absolute best scenario. It's
      unfortunate, but it's life, and that's why I prepare second-best
      alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from that, I also focus on process improvement where possible. To
      me, programming is the easy part of the development process. It's managing
      design, task creation, integration, testing, and all that other junk that
      are the problems. So I usually try to enlighten my coworkers and
      colleagues when possible. I also love learning, as I mentioned under the
      Skills section, so I'm very receptive to when coworkers and colleagues
      want to enlighten me as well.
