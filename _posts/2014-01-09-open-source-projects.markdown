It's been a while since I've updated my site, and I can't actually believe I
haven't posted why sooner: I'm heading on a trip to Europe for almost three
entire months. I've been trying to get everything in order, both in terms of
setting up the trip and necessary supplies, and getting ready to put my
necessities from home into storage and rid myself of everything else. But one
thing I wanted to make sure I had ready prior to leaving: my open source project
page.

I've got a few open source projects, which are visible on my
[GitHub profile][gh]. Most of them are simply forks of other projects that I
either toy with locally or have attempted to make updates to. But there are some
I've created myself and am hoping to enter into the open source
community.

Currently there are two: [ruby-view-abstractor][rva] and [rsvp][rsvp]. Both are
being set up to become Ruby Gems. You can check out their individual pages for
more details. The pages on my website are more like summaries than detailed
overviews and documentation; for a deeper look at what a project is all about, I
recommend checking out its GitHub page as I attempt to put as much useful
information as I can in my `README.md` files.

Being open source I obviously welcome contributions. But please keep in mind, if
you want to contribute, that I won't be heavily active for the next few
months. I may check my emails once or twice a day, at most, so if any patches
don't immediately look good, it could take a few days or weeks for us to have a
proper back-and-forth conversation before I feel it is ready to merge. Once I
get back from Europe I will become far more active in these projects.

I will post a link to a new "travel blog" that my girlfriend and I are going to
be using while traveling Europe. I may try to also update this blog from time to
time, but since I won't have a real laptop with me it could prove too cumbersome
to be worth my time.
