    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </div>

  <p>
    Welcome! My name is Tyler Margison, but you can call
    me <code>kolorahl</code>, or <code>kolo</code>, or <code>dude</code>;
    anything is fine. I want to thank you for visiting my website. A couple
    quick things before I tell you about myself:
    <ol>
      <li>At the very top of every page is the main navigation bar. Use it to
      quickly jump between the main pages of this blog site.</li>
      <li>On the right side of every page is a "personal bar", which reminds you
      what my real name is, just in case you took me up on that offer to call me
      anything you wanted and forgot what the real one is. See? I got you
      covered; no awkward moments where you're standing around thinking, "What
      was his name again?" Oh, it also contains links to my GitHub and Twitter
      accounts as of writing this. This could expand to other online profiles I
      may have in the future that I wish to share.
    </ol>
  </p>

    Alright, we've got my name and the general setup of the website out of the
    way, what does that leave... Well, for starters, I am a software
    engineer. You could view it as a fancy term for "programmer," but I like to
    think that I take the role a little bit further: I design and implement
    software solutions for businesses. Historically that business has been in
    the video gaming industry, but the practices I try to hold myself to can be
    applied in any industry. And as for the rest about me, let's do this up
    list-style, because who doesn't like lists? Am I right?
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      I'm a <b>gamer</b>. I love board games, video games, and dice
      games. Some card games are fun too,
      like <a href="http://amzn.to/16vKTi3" target="_blank">Munchkins</a>
      and <a href="http://amzn.to/10PIY9h" target="_blank">Cards Against
        Humanity</a>. I also love pen &amp; paper games,
      like <a href="http://amzn.to/10PJp3l" target="_blank">Dungeons and
        Dragons</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/12HIgrZ"
                           target="_blank">Shadowrun</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      I <b>watch anime</b>. Yeah, it's stereotypical, whatever. I'm white, I'm
      a programmer, and I love video games; let's go par for the
      course. Favorite series: tie
      between <a href="http://amzn.to/16vNSXx" target="_blank">Darker than
        Black</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/11H12Fd" target="_blank">Code
        Geass</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      I like <b>learning new tech</b>. Currently I'm working on a pet project
      involving Erlang, Riak, Websockets, and HTML 5's Canvas. I've dabbled in
      Erlang and HTML 5's Canvas before, but this will be my first major dive
      into them, and also the first time using Websockets and Riak. Exciting!
    </li>
    <li>
      I <b>speak English</b>. Like, really good and stuff. Totally. Not making
      this up, bro. This is teh fo' real deal.
    </li>
    <li>
      I <b>hate working in an office setting</b>. Not only do I accomplish at
      least the same amount of productivity when I work from home as when I'm
      in an office environment, but I feel more energetic and my happiness
      level is over 9000! It's just a better way to work, in my opinion. And
      with Skype, Google Hangouts, and celluar phones (those things most
      people play "games" on) it's incredibly easy to stay connected while
      working remotely.
    </li>
    <li>
      I <b>own, actively use, and completely enjoy having a Windows
        Phone</b>. That's right, get over it. It's a damn fine phone. I don't
      care if it doesn't have PooglePuffle or some other stupid and
      unnecessary app available for it; it does everything I need my phone to
      do and it does it better than iPhone or Android. It also has a super
      slick interface design that I am totally loving. Right now it's WP7 and
      not the latest WP8, but that's only because Piece-Of-Shit-Sprint, as I
      believe they've officially rebranded to, does not yet carry any WP8
      models. Sadness.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm linking to products using the <b>Amazon Associates Program</b>,
      which is a way for me to make money if you buy something using the
      custom links on my website. And you should totally buy the stuff I link
      to, because I can use that money to help pay off the hosting fees for
      this site as well make awesome games and other software. Plus I like
      money, so get to buying stuff already.
    </li>
    <li>
      I shall one day <b>rule the world</b>. Don't worry, after I become a
      ruler, things
      will <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpyPI1IIIm8"
              target="_blank">be better</a>.
    </li>
