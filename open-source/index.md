<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Open Source Projects</h1>
</div>

I will try to keep a directory here of open source projects I am heading up, and
are active to some degree.

- [rva: Ruby View Abstractor][rva]
- [rsvp: Ruby Schema Validation Project][rsvp]

My [GitHub profile][gh] is also a great place to check out what open source
projects I am working on/with, either my own projects or others I am interested
in.
