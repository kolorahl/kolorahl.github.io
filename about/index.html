    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </div>

  <p>
    Welcome! My name is Tyler Margison, but you can call
    me <code>kolorahl</code>, or <code>kolo</code>, or <code>dude</code>;
    anything is fine. I want to thank you for visiting my website. A couple
    quick things before I tell you about myself:
    <ol>
      <li>At the very top of every page is the main navigation bar. Use it to
      quickly jump between the main pages of this blog site.</li>
      <li>On the right side of every page is a "personal bar", which reminds you
      what my real name is, just in case you took me up on that offer to call me
      anything you wanted and forgot what the real one is. See? I got you
      covered; no awkward moments where you're standing around thinking, "What
      was his name again?" Oh, it also contains links to my GitHub and Twitter
      accounts as of writing this. This could expand to other online profiles I
      may have in the future that I wish to share.
    </ol>
  </p>

    Alright, we've got my name and the general setup of the website out of the
    way, what does that leave... Well, for starters, I am a software
    engineer. You could view it as a fancy term for "programmer," but I like to
    think that I take the role a little bit further: I design and implement
    software solutions for businesses. Historically that business has been in
    the video gaming industry, but the practices I try to hold myself to can be
    applied in any industry. And as for the rest about me, let's do this up
    list-style, because who doesn't like lists? Am I right?
  </p>

  <ul class="list-group list-striped">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      I'm a <b>gamer</b>. I love board games, video games, and dice
      games. Some card games are fun too,
      like <a href="http://amzn.to/16vKTi3" target="_blank">Munchkins</a>
      and <a href="http://amzn.to/10PIY9h" target="_blank">Cards Against
        Humanity</a>. I also love pen &amp; paper games,
      like <a href="http://amzn.to/10PJp3l" target="_blank">Dungeons and
        Dragons</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/12HIgrZ"
                           target="_blank">Shadowrun</a>.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      I <b>watch anime</b>. Yeah, it's stereotypical, whatever. I'm white, I'm
      a programmer, and I love video games; let's go
      <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW8zuayFocA" target="_blank">par
      for the course</a>. Favorite series: tie
      between <a href="http://amzn.to/16vNSXx" target="_blank">Darker than
        Black</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/11H12Fd" target="_blank">Code
        Geass</a>.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      I like <b>learning new tech</b>. Currently I'm working on a pet project
      involving Erlang, Riak, Websockets, and HTML 5. I've dabbled in
      Erlang and the HTML 5 Canvas before, but this will be my first major dive
      into them, and also the first time using Websockets and Riak. Exciting!
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      I use <b>"large", easy-to-read, sans-serif fonts</b> for all my personal
      websites. I also prefer <b>dark backgrounds with light foreground
      coloring</b>. Aside from being easier to work with as a
      developer, <a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/">this man</a> describes it
      quite nicely on his site FAQ. I'll post my favorite snippet below:
      <blockquote cite="http://maddox.xmission.com/c.cgi?u=faq">I've chosen a
        black background for most of my text because it's easier on the eyes
        than staring at a white screen. Think about it: your monitor is not a
        piece of paper, no matter how hard you try to make it one. Staring at a
        white background while you read is like staring at a light
        bulb.<br/>
        - Maddox</blockquote>

      I'm looking over the completed list and, wow, this is a <b>very lengthy
      list</b>! Fear not visitor, I shall endeavor to entertain with some of
      these points. I don't want you falling asleep on me, especially not once
      you've made it this far...
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      I <b>speak English</b>. Like, really good and stuff. Totally. Not making
      this up, bro. This is teh fo' real deal. And if you keep reading, you
      shan't be disappointed. That's some
      high-quality <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4m263uHunc"
      target="_blank">old English</a> right there.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      I <b>hate working in an office setting</b>. I am as productive, though
      usually more so, when I work from home as when I'm in the office,
      but I feel more energetic and my happiness level is over 9000! It's just a
      better way to work, in my opinion. And with Skype, Google Hangouts, and
      celluar phones it's incredibly easy to stay connected while working
      remotely.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      I own, actively use, and completely enjoy having a <b>Windows
        Phone</b>. That's right, get over it. It's a damn fine phone. I don't
      care if it doesn't have PooglePuffle or some other stupid and
      unnecessary app available for it; it does everything I need my phone to
      do and it does it better than iPhone or Android, in my personal opinion.
      It also has a super slick interface design that I am totally loving.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      I'm linking to products using the <b>Amazon Associates Program</b>,
      which is a way for me to make money if you buy something using the
      custom links on my website. And you should totally buy the stuff I link
      to, because the stuff I promote is awesome. Plus, I can use that money to
      help pay off the hosting fees for this site as well make awesome games and
      other software.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      I shall one day <b>rule the world</b>. Don't worry, after I become a
      ruler, things
      will <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpyPI1IIIm8"
              target="_blank">be better</a>.
