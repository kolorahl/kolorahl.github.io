    <h1>Resume</h1>
  </div>

  <p>
    Some people have tried to get into contact with me and want to know more
    about my skills and my background, so I've created this page. Check below
    for the different ways of viewing my professional resume.
  </p>

  <h3>OneDrive</h3>
  <p>
    You can check out my resume online
    via <a href="http://1drv.ms/1kJGj9k">Microsoft OneDrive</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>re.vu</h3>
  <p>
    There's a visual-pleasing site
    called <a href="http://re.vu/tyler.margison">re.vu</a> where I also try to
    keep my skills and work experience updated. It's like an interactive resume,
    kind of, but with more eye-candy than interaction.
  </p>

  <h3>Right Here</h3>
  <p>
    If you're not into OneDrive or re.vu, don't worry: I've got a version of
    my resume right on this page. Has all the stuff you need to know in an
    easy-to-consume format.

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
      I can work in any programming language. This is not a joke. My personal
      philosophy is that a programming language is just a tool. And like any
      good worker, one should know many tools and have the capacity to quickly
      learn new ones. After all, you wouldn't hire someone that only knows how
      to use a hammer when what the job requires is a screwdriver. Like the good
      worker, I make sure I know many programming languages and have the ability
      to quickly learn new ones. The same goes for any software technology:
      databases, libraries, tools... I make it a personal mission to know about
      as much of these as possible, and I love learning about new ones.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I've worked for CDM Technologies, Sony Online Entertainment, ngmoco:),
      Quark Games, KIXEYE, and more. I've done consultation work for Google,
      Facebook, Amazon, and others. I like contract work most because I'm
      constantly learning new tech and skills to keep up with the jobs. I've
      worked front-end, back-end, database, customer support, and worn a few
      other hats here and there.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      I was given a test called the HSEE, or High School Exit Exam, after only
      one year of high school. The test was described as containing the minimum
      knowledge required to be considered for graduating high school. I aced
      it, but they didn't let me exit high school after doing so, which seemed
      ironic to me. I did the college thing too, but I find that work experience
      is a better education than any school or college.
    </p>

    <h2>Why You Should Hire Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm an extremely fair and hard-working individual. If you have work you
      need done, or if you just want a consultation about what it is that needs
      to be done, I will always aim to deliver the best and second-best
      options. Why do I include second-best? Because I know time, money, and
      other factors sometimes prevent the absolute best scenario. It's
      unfortunate, but it's life, and that's why I prepare second-best
      alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from that, I also focus on process improvement where possible. To
      me, programming is the easy part of the development process. It's managing
      design, task creation, integration, testing, and all that other junk that
      are the problem areas. So I usually try to enlighten my coworkers and
      colleagues when appropriate. I also love learning, as I mentioned under
      the Skills section, so I'm very receptive to when coworkers and colleagues
      want to enlighten me as well.
