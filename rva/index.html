    <h1>Ruby View Abstractor</h1>
  </div>

  <p>
    This is my attempt at making the Ruby (and Rails) approach to model and view
    generation more pragmatic. Through this attempt I hope to make creating,
    tracking, and modifying data models easier. I also hope to remove a lot of
    the code redundancy that existed before.
