<p>
  Pardon the lack of excitement on this page. I'll get to crafting a better
  "about me" section at a later date when I've got some more free time and the
  right mindset for it. For now I'll just say that I'm a programmer that loves
  the problem solving aspect of it. Most of my past colleagues generally focus
  on coding as opposed to problem solving, which might sound wrong to you, but
  that fact is that more people just like diving into coding a solution than
  first thinking about what the most appropriate solution is. I also love
  learning new tech; languages, databases, frameworks, oh my! I feel that the
  web is the future for many applications, except perhaps gaming. Until browsers
  can deliver low-level GPU access and the Internet can deliver large volumes of
  data more reliably, we may be stuck with downloading or purchasing video game
  for PCs and consoles a while longer.
