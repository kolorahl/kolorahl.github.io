I have a joke [resume page][resume] currently. It was intended to be an
short-term placeholder, but because of recent situations it's been prolonged far
too long. But as of today I'm working on my original goal for it: upgrading the
resume experience and having the resume itself be part of my work. Just as a
graphics designer or an artist can combine visually creative elements into their
resume, I plan to use my knowledge and skill of JavaScript, HTML, and
programming in general to create an interactive resume experience. I'll post
another update once it goes live.
